<h1 align="center">Rust Base Builder</h1>

<p align="center">
App that lets you create any rust base, simulate a raid and calculate all the building + upkeep cost.
</p>

<h1 align="center">Key Features:</h1>

<h2 align="center">Base Editor | Edit Mode</h2>

<p align="center">
You can build your base from scratch, view and modify it.
Choose any object from the list on the left side and start placing it on the grid. <br>
Before you place any object, you can rotate it with "Q" and "E" buttons, change the building height.
</p>

<p align="center">
All the build cost will be displayed on the right side along with the upkeep scaling tiers:<br>
tier 1: 10% for the first 15 objects<br>
tier 2: 15% for next 75 objects<br>
tier 3: 20% for another 75 objects<br>
tier 4: 33% for any object above 175th<br>
  You can also enable the miscs (workbenches, storages, furnaces) to be counted in the build cost (with upkeep ommited)

<h2 align="center">Raid Simulator</h2>

<p align="center">
Simulate an raid attack on your own base to test its weaknesses.
</p>

<p align="center">
First, choose what type of "tool" you want to raid with:<br>
- rockets <br> 
- C4s <br> 
- EXP. 5.56 ammo<br>
- satchel charges<br> 
- "most efficient" to automatically calculate the most efficient way to destroy the selected structure.<br>
<br>
Once you've selected the type, you can start destroying the objects with mouse click. <br>
If you want to start the raid again, or reset it, use the "reset raid" button.
